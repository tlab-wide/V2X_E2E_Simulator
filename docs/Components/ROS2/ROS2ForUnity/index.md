# ROS2 For Unity
[*Ros2ForUnity*](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2-for-unity) (`R2FU`) module is a communication solution that effectively connects *Unity* and the *ROS2* ecosystem, maintaining a strong integration.
Unlike other solutions, it doesn't rely on bridging communication but rather utilizes the *ROS2* middleware stack (specifically the `rcl` layer and below), enabling the inclusion of *ROS2* nodes within *Unity* simulations.

`R2FU` is used in *AWSIM* for many reasons.
First of all, because it offers high-performance integration between *Unity* and *ROS2*, with improved throughput and lower latencies compared to bridging solutions.
It provides real *ROS2* functionality for simulation entities in *Unity*, supports standard and custom messages, and includes convenient abstractions and tools, all wrapped as a *Unity* asset.
For a detailed description, please see [*README*](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2-for-unity/blob/master/README.md).

## Prerequisites
This asset can be prepared in two flavours:

- *standalone mode* - where no *ROS2* installation is required on target machine, e.g., your *Unity* simulation server.
All required dependencies are installed and can be used e.g. as a complete set of *Unity* plugins.
- *overlay mode* - where the *ROS2* installation is required on target machine.
Only asset libraries and generated messages are installed therefore *ROS2* instance must be sourced.

By default, asset `R2FU` in *AWSIM* is prepared in *standalone mode*.
Thanks to this, *ROS2* instance doesn't need to be sourced - all you have to do is run the *Unity* editor.

!!! question "Can't see topics"
    There are no errors but I can't see topics published by `R2FU`

    - Make sure your DDS ([Localhost settings](../../../GettingStarted/QuickStartDemo/#localhost-settings)) config is correct.
    - Sometimes *ROS2* daemon brakes up when changing network interfaces or *ROS2* version.
Try to stop it forcefully (`pkill -9 ros2_daemon`) and restart (`ros2 daemon start`).

## Concept
Describing the concept of using `R2FU` in *AWSIM*, we distinguish:

- *ROS2Node* - it is the equivalent of a node in *ROS2*, it has its own name, it can have any number of subscribers, publishers, service servers and service clients.
In the current *AWSIM* implementation, there is only one main node.
- *ROS2Clock* - it is responsible for generating the simulation time using the selected source.
- *SimulatorROS2Node* - it is a class that is directly responsible for *AWSIM<->ROS2* communication, and contains one instance each of *ROS2Node* and *ROS2Clock*, so it creates the main *AWSIM* node in *ROS2* and simulates the time from the selected source (currently [UnityTimeSource](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Time.html) is used).
It is initialized at the moment of running the scene in *Unity* - thanks to the [`RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethodAttribute.html) mark.
- *Publisher* - it is the equivalent of the publisher in *ROS2*, it uses a single topic on which it can publish a selected type of message, and it has a selected [*QoS*][qos] profile.
Each publisher in *AWSIM* is created in *ROS2Node* object of class *SimulatorROS2Node*.
- *Subscriber* - it is the equivalent of the subscriber in *ROS2*, it uses a single topic from which it subscribes to the selected type of message, and it has a selected [*QoS*][qos] profile.
Each subscriber in *AWSIM* is created in *ROS2Node* object of class *SimulatorROS2Node*.
 
<!-- - TODO: *Service Server* -  -->
<!-- - TODO: *Service Client* - -->

The *SimulatorROS2Node* implementation, thanks to the use of `R2FU`, allows you to add communication via *ROS2* to any Unity component.
For example, we can receive control commands from any other *ROS2* node and publish the current state of *Ego*, such as its position in the environment.

!!! tip "Simulation time"
    If you want to use system time (*ROS2* time) instead of *Unity* time, use `ROS2TimeSource` instead of `UnityTimeSource` in the `SimulatorROS2Node` class.

## Package structure
`Ros2ForUnity` asset contains:

- *Plugins* - dynamically loaded libraries for *Windows* and *Linux* (`*.dll` and `*.so` files).
In addition to the necessary libraries, here are the libraries created as a result of generation the types of *ROS2* messages that are used in communication.
- *Scripts* - scripts for using `R2FU`  in *Unity* - details [below](#scripts).
- *Extension Scripts* - scripts for using `R2FU` in *AWSIM*, provide abstractions of a single main *Node* and simplify the interface  - details [below](#extension-scripts).
These scripts are not in the library itself, but directly in the directory `Assets/AWSIM/Scripts/ROS/**`.

### Scripts
- `ROS2UnityCore` - the principal class for handling *ROS2* nodes and executables.
Spins and executes actions (e.g. clock, sensor publish triggers) in a dedicated thread.
- `ROS2UnityComponent` - `ROS2UnityCore` adapted to work as a *Unity* component.
- `ROS2Node` - a class representing a *ROS2* node, it should be constructed through `ROS2UnityComponent` class, which also handles spinning.
- `ROS2ForUnity` - an internal class responsible for handling checking, proper initialization and shutdown of *ROS2* communication,
- `ROS2ListenerExample` - an example class provided for testing of basic *ROS2->Unity* communication.
- `ROS2TalkerExample` - an example class provided for testing of basic *Unity->ROS2* communication.
- `ROS2PerformanceTest` - an example class provided for performance testing of *ROS2<->Unity* communication.
- `Sensor` - an abstract base class for *ROS2*-enabled sensor.
- `Transformations` - a set of transformation functions between coordinate systems of *Unity* and *ROS2*.
- `PostInstall` - an internal class responsible for installing `R2FU` metadata files.
- `Time` scripts - a set of classes that provide  the ability to use different time sources:
    - `ROS2Clock` - *ROS2* clock class that for interfacing between a time source (*Unity* or *ROS2* system time) and *ROS2* messages.
    - `ROS2TimeSource` - acquires *ROS2* time (system time by default).
    - `UnityTimeSource` - acquires *Unity* time.
    - `DotnetTimeSource` - acquires *Unity* `DateTime` based clock that has resolution increased using `Stopwatch`.
    - `ITimeSource` - interface for general time extraction from any source.
    - `TimeUtils` - utils for time conversion.

### Extension Scripts
Additionally, in order to adapt *AWSIM* to the use of `R2FU`, the following scripts are used:

- `SimulatorROS2Node` - it is a class that is directly responsible for *AWSIM<->ROS2* communication.
- `ClockPublisher` - allows the publication of the simulation time from the clock running in the *SimulatorROS2Node*.
It must be added as a component to the scene in order to publish the current time when the scene is run.

    ![clock_publisher](clock_publisher.png)

- `QoSSettings` - it is the equivalent of *ROS2* [*QoS*][qos], which allows to specify the *QoS* for subscribers and publishers in *AWSIM*.
It uses the [`QualityOfServiceProfile`](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2cs/blob/develop/src/ros2cs/ros2cs_core/QualityOfServiceProfile.cs) implementation from the [Ros2cs](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2cs) library.
- `ROS2Utility` - it is a class with utils that allow, for example, to convert positions in the *ROS2* coordinate system to the *AWSIM* coordinate system.
- `DiagnosticsManager` - prints diagnostics for desired elements described in `*.yaml` config file.

## Default message types

- [common_interfaces](https://index.ros.org/r/common_interfaces/github-ros2-common_interfaces/):
    - [`std_msgs`](https://index.ros.org/p/std_msgs/github-ros2-common_interfaces/#humble).

    - [`unique_identifier_msgs`](https://index.ros.org/p/unique_identifier_msgs/github-ros2-unique_identifier_msgs/#humble).

In order for the message package to be used in *Unity*, its `*.dll` and `*.so` libraries must be generated using `R2FU`.

!!! tip "Custom message"
    If you want to generate a custom message to allow it to be used in *AWSIM* please read [this tutorial](../AddACustomROS2Message/).

## Use of generated messages in *Unity*
Each message type is composed of other types - which can also be a complex type.
All of them are based on built-in [*C#* types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/built-in-types).
The most common built-in types in messages are `bool`, `int`, `double` and `string`.
These types have their communication equivalents using *ROS2*.

A good example of a complex type that is added to other complex types in order to specify a reference - in the form of a timestamp and a frame - is [std_msgs/Header][header].
This message has the following form:

```csharp
builtin_interfaces/msg/Time stamp
string frame_id
```

!!! warning "ROS2 directive"
    In order to work with *ROS2* in *Unity*, remember to add the directive `using ROS2;` at the top of the file to import types from this namespace.
    
### Create an object
The simplest way to create an object of [`Header`][header] type is:

```csharp
var header = new std_msgs.msg.Header()
{
    Frame_id = "map"
}
```

It is not required to define the value of each field.
As you can see, it creates an object, filling only `frame_id` field - and left the field of complex [`builtin_interfaces/msg/Time`][time] type initialized by default.
Time is an important element of any message, how to fill it is written [here](#filling-a-time).

### Accessing and filling in message fields 
As you might have noticed in the previous example, a *ROS2* message in *Unity* is just a structure containing the same fields - keep the same names and types.
Access to its fields for reading and filling is the same as for any *C#* structure.

```csharp
var header2 = new std_msgs.msg.Header();
header2.Frame_id = "map";
header2.Stamp.sec = "1234567";
Debug.Log($"StampSec: {header2.Stamp.sec} and Frame: {header2.Frame_id}");
```

!!! warning "Field names"
    There is one always-present difference in field names.
    The **first letter** of each message field in *Unity* is **always** **uppercase** - even if the base *ROS2* message from which it is generated is lowercase.

### Filling a time
In order to complete the time field of the [`Header`][header] message, we recommend the following methods in *AWSIM*:

1. When the message has no [`Header`][header] but only the [`Time`][time] type:

    ```csharp
    var header2 = new std_msgs.msg.Header();
    header2.Stamp = SimulatorROS2Node.GetCurrentRosTime();
    ```

2. When the message has a [`Header`][header] - like for example  [autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs/VelocityReport](https://github.com/tier4/autoware_auto_msgs/blob/tier4/main/autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs/msg/VelocityReport.idl):

    ```csharp
    velocityReportMsg = new autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs.msg.VelocityReport()
    {
        Header = new std_msgs.msg.Header()
        {
            Frame_id = "map",
        }
    };
    var velocityReportMsgHeader = velocityReportMsg as MessageWithHeader;
    SimulatorROS2Node.UpdateROSTimestamp(ref velocityReportMsgHeader);
    ```

These methods allow to fill the [`Time`][time] field in the message object with the simulation time - from *ROS2Clock*

### Create a message with array
Some message types contain an [array](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/arrays/) of some type.
An example of such a message is [`nav_msgs/Path`](https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/nav_msgs/msg/Path.html), which has a [`PoseStamped`](https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/geometry_msgs/msg/PoseStamped.html) array.
In order to fill such an array, you must first create a [`List<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/pl-pl/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1?view=net-8.0), fill it and then convert it to a [raw array](https://learn.microsoft.com/pl-pl/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1.toarray?view=net-8.0).

```csharp
var posesList = new List<geometry_msgs.msg.PoseStamped>();
for(int i=0; i<=5;++i)
{
    var poseStampedMsg = new geometry_msgs.msg.PoseStamped();
    poseStampedMsg.Pose.Position.X = i;
    poseStampedMsg.Pose.Position.Y = 5-i;
    var poseStampedMsgHeader = poseStampedMsg as MessageWithHeader;
    SimulatorROS2Node.UpdateROSTimestamp(ref poseStampedMsgHeader);
    posesList.Add(poseStampedMsg);
}
var pathMsg = new nav_msgs.msg.Path(){Poses=posesList.ToArray()};
var pathMsgHeader = pathMsg as MessageWithHeader;
SimulatorROS2Node.UpdateROSTimestamp(ref pathMsgHeader);
// pathMsg is ready
```

### Publish on the topic
In order to publish messages, a publisher object must be created.
The static method `CreatePublisher` of the `SimulatorROS2Node` makes it easy.
You must specify the *type* of message, the *topic* on which it will be published and the *QoS* profile.<br>
Below is an example of `autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs.msg.VelocityReport` type message publication with a frequency of `30Hz` on `/vehicle/status/velocity_status` topic, the [*QoS*][qos] profile is `(Reliability=Reliable, Durability=Volatile, History=Keep last, Depth=1`):

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using ROS2;

namespace AWSIM
{
    public class VehicleReportRos2Publisher : MonoBehaviour
    {
        float timer = 0;
        int publishHz = 30;
        QoSSettings qosSettings = new QoSSettings()
        {
            ReliabilityPolicy = ReliabilityPolicy.QOS_POLICY_RELIABILITY_RELIABLE,
            DurabilityPolicy = DurabilityPolicy.QOS_POLICY_DURABILITY_VOLATILE,
            HistoryPolicy = HistoryPolicy.QOS_POLICY_HISTORY_KEEP_LAST,
            Depth = 1,
        };
        string velocityReportTopic = "/vehicle/status/velocity_status";
        autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs.msg.VelocityReport velocityReportMsg;
        IPublisher<autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs.msg.VelocityReport> velocityReportPublisher;

        void Start()
        {
            // Create a message object and fill in the constant fields
            velocityReportMsg = new autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs.msg.VelocityReport()
            {
                Header = new std_msgs.msg.Header()
                {
                    Frame_id = "map",
                }
            };

            // Create publisher with specific topic and QoS profile
            velocityReportPublisher = SimulatorROS2Node.CreatePublisher<autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs.msg.VelocityReport>(velocityReportTopic, qosSettings.GetQoSProfile());
        }

         bool NeedToPublish()
        {
            timer += Time.deltaTime;
            var interval = 1.0f / publishHz;
            interval -= 0.00001f;
            if (timer < interval)
                return false;
            timer = 0;
            return true;
        }

        void FixedUpdate()
        {
            // Provide publications with a given frequency
            if (NeedToPublish())
            {
                // Fill in non-constant fields
                velocityReportMsg.Longitudinal_velocity = 1.00f;
                velocityReportMsg.Lateral_velocity = 0.00f;
                velocityReportMsg.Heading_rate = 0.00f;

                // Update Stamp
                var velocityReportMsgHeader = velocityReportMsg as MessageWithHeader;
                SimulatorROS2Node.UpdateROSTimestamp(ref velocityReportMsgHeader);

                // Publish
                velocityReportPublisher.Publish(velocityReportMsg);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Subscribe to the topic
In order to subscribe messages, a subscriber object must be created.
The static method `CreateSubscription` of the `SimulatorROS2Node` makes it easy.
You must specify the *type* of message, the *topic* from which it will be subscribed and the [*QoS*][qos] profile.
In addition, the *callback* must be defined, which will be called when the message is received - in particular, it can be defined as a [lambda expression](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-expressions).<br>
Below is an example of `std_msgs.msg.Bool` type message subscription on `/vehicle/is_vehicle_stopped` topic, the [*QoS*][qos] profile is [`“system default”`][qos]:
```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using ROS2;

namespace AWSIM
{
    public class VehicleStoppedSubscriber : MonoBehaviour
    {
        QoSSettings qosSettings = new QoSSettings();
        string isVehicleStoppedTopic = "/vehicle/is_vehicle_stopped";
        bool isVehicleStopped = false;
        ISubscription<std_msgs.msg.Bool> isVehicleStoppedSubscriber;

        void Start()
        {
            isVehicleStoppedSubscriber = SimulatorROS2Node.CreateSubscription<std_msgs.msg.Bool>(isVehicleStoppedTopic, VehicleStoppedCallback, qosSettings.GetQoSProfile());
        }

        void VehicleStoppedCallback(std_msgs.msg.Bool msg)
        {
            isVehicleStopped = msg.Data;
        }

        void OnDestroy()
        {
            SimulatorROS2Node.RemoveSubscription<std_msgs.msg.Bool>(isVehicleStoppedSubscriber);
        }
    }
}
```
