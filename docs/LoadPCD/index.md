# Loading PCD Files in Unity

Loading Point Cloud Data (PCD) files into Unity can be challenging and often requires a paid solution. In this project, we've utilized the Pcx repository available on [GitHub](https://tlab-wide.github.io/V2X_E2E_Simulator/Simple-AV/SystemSetup/). However, it's important to note that Pcx is primarily designed to work with `.ply` files. We recommend using CloudCompare to convert `.pcd` files to `.ply`.

## Conversion Process in CloudCompare

When loading a PCD file into CloudCompare, pay close attention to the XYZ transformations, as illustrated below:

Ensure that you accurately fill out the input fields based on your data:

After configuring the transformations, save the file in the `.ply` binary format.

## Integrating .PLY Files into Unity

To use the converted `.ply` files in Unity, you will first need to install PCX. Begin by locating the `manifest.json` file in the Unity projectâ€™s `Packages` folder.

Once PCX is installed, you can drag and drop the `.ply` files into your Unity environment. However, for optimal performance, it is advisable to clean up previously added project files. This practice ensures a smoother engine performance and enhances the quality and placement of 3D models prior to conducting simulation tests.
