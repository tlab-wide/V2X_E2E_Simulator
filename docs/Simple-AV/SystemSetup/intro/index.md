# Environment Setup for simple-AV

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up an environment in Windows 10 for launching the simple-AV ROS node, including the installation of AWSIM, ROS2 Humble, and WSL.

To develop and run simple-AV, it is essential to establish communication between AWSIM and ROS2. For this project, AWSIM is installed on Windows 10, while Ubuntu 22.04 is installed on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) within Windows 10. ROS2 is then installed on Ubuntu 22.04 within WSL.

Given the crucial need for seamless communication between simple-AV and AWSIM, we ensure proper setup for the exchange of ROS topics. This involves configuring the network settings to enable ROS topics to be sent and received correctly between the Windows 10 environment and the ROS2 installation on WSL.

More specifically, this document goes through the installation process of

* [Installing WSL2 on Windows 10](../WSL/index.md)
* [Installing ROS2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04 on WSL2](../InstallingROS2/index.md)
* [Setting up AWSIM on Window 10](../AWSIM_on_Windows/index.md)
* [Setting up Awsim and WSL2 connection](../Windows_WSL_Connection/index.md)

<b>For running AWSIM on Windows and get the topics in WSL, you donâ€™t need to actually install ROS2 for Windows.</b>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By following this guide, you will create a development environment that supports efficient communication between AWSIM and ROS2, enabling the successful deployment of the simple-AV ROS node.

### Run The Build Awsim Scene

After doing the 4 steps mentioned above, run the Build of Shinjuku Scene provided in the link below or any other built scenes.

### Run the WSL2

Now, run the WSL and source the ROS2 init using the command below:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

After sourcing the ROS2 you can get a topic list and see the all the topics that are being published and subscribed by AWSIM.

This means we have successfully setup our system and create a communication between Awsim on Windows and Ros2 on WSL. However, currently we are unable to access all of the topics and we must define message types of the topics. Please refer to [Building Messages](../../BuildingMessages/index.md) page to see the full documentation.
